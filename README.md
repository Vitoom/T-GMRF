# T-GMRF

This repo open the python source code for "Time-varying Gaussian Markov Random Fields Learning for Multivariate Time Series Clustering".

## Using T-GMRF

T-GMRF is a novel clustering approach for Multivariate Time Series Clustering (MTS) data with particular interest in capturing its timevarying correlation patterns. It has several hyperparameters as follows:

+ **width**: The sliding windows width for GMRF series extraction.
+ **stride**: The sliding windows stride for GMRF series extraction.
+ **lamb**: The temporal smothness regularization for GMRF series extraction.
+ **beta**: The structural sparsity regularization for GMRF series extraction.
+ **diff_{threshold}**: The slope difference threshold for identifying clustering radiuses.
+ **slope_{threshold}**: The slope threshold for identifying clustring radiuses.

## Example

1. Install depedency pakcages.
```bash
pip install sklearn, snap, tslearn, tqdm, hdbscan, pyreadr, 'ray[tune]'
```

2. Clone the code to local.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vitoom/T-GMRF.git
```

3. Run T-GMRF on BasicMotions dataset from [UEA Repo](http://www.timeseriesclassification.com/dataset.php).
```bash
python Run_Test.py
```

+ [**FCFW**](https://github.com/Vitoom/T-GMRF/tree/main/Baselines/FCFW): Adopted a hybrid fuzzy membership matrix generated by performing DTW on all variables and reconsidering each dimensionâ€™s shapebased distance (SBD). 
+ [**CSPCA**](https://github.com/Vitoom/T-GMRF/tree/main/Baselines/CSPCA): Encoded MTS data with vectors that were dimension reduction result of covariances using PCA.
+ [**HMM**](https://github.com/Vitoom/T-GMRF/tree/main/Baselines/HMM): Mapped each trajectory into an HMM and then defined a suitable distance between HMMs.
+ [**MC2PCA**](https://github.com/Vitoom/T-GMRF/tree/main/Baselines/MC2PCA): Assumed a common projection axes as prototype of each cluster in K-Means clustering.
